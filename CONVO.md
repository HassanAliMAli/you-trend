I want you to rollback to the latest github commit. where there are no tests files and codes. we did so much to remove all these files and code and the convo.md file that you recreated again.

## Assistant Response (Timestamp: 2024-07-20T12:05:05Z)
Okay, I understand. You want to revert the project to the state it was in on the latest GitHub commit, before I started adding test files and re-creating `CONVO.md`.

I have performed the rollback to commit `96ab9f3`. All test files and previous `CONVO.md` have been removed.
