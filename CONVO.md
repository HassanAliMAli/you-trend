## Conversation Log

- User provided console logs showing 400 Bad Request for `/api/trends`.
- Identified that `api_key` is `null` in the request to the backend.
- `ApiContext.js` logs show `localStorage.getItem('youtube_api_key')` returning `null` at the time of the API call.
- Hypothesized that the API key is either not being saved correctly or is being cleared unintentionally.
- Added a `console.log` to `ApiProvider`'s `useEffect` to check the API key's initial state in `localStorage` when the context mounts.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided new console logs showing `ApiContext: Provider mounted. Initial API key from localStorage: null`, confirming the key is not present in `localStorage` on initial load even after attempting to save it via settings page.
- Inspected `client/src/pages/Settings.js` and found it was using `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage` and not correctly using `ApiContext` functions.
- Refactored `client/src/pages/Settings.js` to use `localStorage` via `ApiContext` and correctly interface with the context for API key and quota management.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` again with the `Settings.js` fix.
- User provided new console logs showing continued `400 Bad Request` and `api_key: null` after previous fixes.
- Confirmed `ApiContext: Provider mounted. Initial API key from localStorage: null` is expected on first load.
- Added `trim()` to `saveApiKey` in `ApiContext.js` and more detailed logging for the save process.
- Added logging to `handleSaveSettings` in `Settings.js` to see the key value before saving.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with these logging and trim enhancements.
- User provided console log showing `Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: ...logo192.png`.
- Identified that `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` are missing from `client/public` directory.
- Removed references to the missing icons from `client/public/manifest.json` to resolve the console error.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided new console logs still showing the icon error and `api_key: null` issue.
- Discussed that the icon error is highly likely due to browser caching of the old `manifest.json`.
- Reviewed `ApiContext.js` and `Settings.js` for API key logic. The saving/loading logic appears sound.
- Hypothesized that API key persistence issues might be due to browser extensions, specific browser settings, or subtle React state/lifecycle interactions, as the core code for `localStorage` is straightforward.
- Simplified API key retrieval in `analyzeTrends` and `compareNiches` in `ApiContext.js` for consistency and updated logging.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided new console logs. `ApiContext.js` still reported `null` API key for trends analysis. However, `HomePage.js` (line 18) logged finding an old API key (`AIzaS...Lq2jo`) from `localStorage`.
- Investigated `HomePage.js` and found it uses helper functions from `client/src/utils/api.js` for its API key checks, independently of `ApiContext.js`.
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** Inspected `client/src/utils/api.js` and discovered it was using a different `localStorage` key name (`youtrend_youtube_api_key`) than `ApiContext.js` (`youtube_api_key`). This explains the discrepancy.
- Corrected `API_KEY_STORAGE_KEY` in `client/src/utils/api.js` to `youtube_api_key` to ensure consistency.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided a screenshot of an API key form and asked why the "Update API Key" button wasn't changing anything.
- Identified that the screenshot matched `client/src/components/ApiKeyForm.js`.
- Found that `ApiKeyForm.js`'s `handleClearApiKey` function (for the "Remove" button) was still using the old, incorrect `localStorage` key (`youtrend_youtube_api_key`).
- Modified `handleClearApiKey` in `ApiKeyForm.js` to use the imported `removeApiKey` function from `utils/api.js`, ensuring it uses the correct, standardized key name.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided screenshots showing a new error on the Trends page: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')", after backend returned 200 OK for `/api/trends`.
- Identified that `HomePage.js` was correctly reading the API key from localStorage.
- Hypothesized the new error was in frontend processing of the API response, likely in `ApiContext.js` within `analyzeTrends` or its helpers (`identifyContentGap`, `generateRecommendations`).
- Manually instructed user to add specific `console.log` statements in `generateRecommendations` in `ApiContext.js` to inspect `data.videos` and `data.topics` before `.length` access, due to persistent tool failures editing this file.
- Noticed and corrected a syntax error (`axios.create({x```) in `client/src/contexts/ApiContext.js` that was causing linter issues.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the syntax fix and logging additions.
- User provided screenshots and Heroku logs showing the backend `/api/trends` call is now returning 200 OK with data.
- The frontend Trends page now shows "No videos found matching your criteria" instead of the previous 'length' error.
- Added a `console.log` for the raw `response.data` in `analyzeTrends` in `ApiContext.js` to inspect what the frontend receives before processing.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
