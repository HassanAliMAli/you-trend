## Conversation Log

- User provided console logs showing 400 Bad Request for `/api/trends`.
- Identified that `api_key` is `null` in the request to the backend.
- `ApiContext.js` logs show `localStorage.getItem('youtube_api_key')` returning `null` at the time of the API call.
- Hypothesized that the API key is either not being saved correctly or is being cleared unintentionally.
- Added a `console.log` to `ApiProvider`'s `useEffect` to check the API key's initial state in `localStorage` when the context mounts.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided new console logs showing `ApiContext: Provider mounted. Initial API key from localStorage: null`, confirming the key is not present in `localStorage` on initial load even after attempting to save it via settings page.
- Inspected `client/src/pages/Settings.js` and found it was using `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage` and not correctly using `ApiContext` functions.
- Refactored `client/src/pages/Settings.js` to use `localStorage` via `ApiContext` and correctly interface with the context for API key and quota management.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` again with the `Settings.js` fix.
- User provided new console logs showing continued `400 Bad Request` and `api_key: null` after previous fixes.
- Confirmed `ApiContext: Provider mounted. Initial API key from localStorage: null` is expected on first load.
- Added `trim()` to `saveApiKey` in `ApiContext.js` and more detailed logging for the save process.
- Added logging to `handleSaveSettings` in `Settings.js` to see the key value before saving.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with these logging and trim enhancements.
- User provided console log showing `Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: ...logo192.png`.
- Identified that `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` are missing from `client/public` directory.
- Removed references to the missing icons from `client/public/manifest.json` to resolve the console error.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided new console logs still showing the icon error and `api_key: null` issue.
- Discussed that the icon error is highly likely due to browser caching of the old `manifest.json`.
- Reviewed `ApiContext.js` and `Settings.js` for API key logic. The saving/loading logic appears sound.
- Hypothesized that API key persistence issues might be due to browser extensions, specific browser settings, or subtle React state/lifecycle interactions, as the core code for `localStorage` is straightforward.
- Simplified API key retrieval in `analyzeTrends` and `compareNiches` in `ApiContext.js` for consistency and updated logging.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
- User provided new console logs. `ApiContext.js` still reported `null` API key for trends analysis. However, `HomePage.js` (line 18) logged finding an old API key (`AIzaS...Lq2jo`) from `localStorage`.
- Investigated `HomePage.js` and found it uses helper functions from `client/src/utils/api.js` for its API key checks, independently of `ApiContext.js`.
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** Inspected `client/src/utils/api.js` and discovered it was using a different `localStorage` key name (`youtrend_youtube_api_key`) than `ApiContext.js` (`youtube_api_key`). This explains the discrepancy.
- Corrected `API_KEY_STORAGE_KEY` in `client/src/utils/api.js` to `youtube_api_key` to ensure consistency.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
